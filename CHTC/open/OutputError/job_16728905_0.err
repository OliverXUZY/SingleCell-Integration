Matplotlib created a temporary config/cache directory at /var/lib/condor/execute/slot1/dir_47824/matplotlib-ryj1wafw because the default path (/.config/matplotlib) is not a writable directory; it is highly recommended to set the MPLCONFIGDIR environment variable to a writable directory, in particular to speed up the import of Matplotlib and to better support multiprocessing.
